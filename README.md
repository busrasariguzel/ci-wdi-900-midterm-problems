# Midterm Problems

### Setup

1. Fork the repo.
2. Clone it down.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm test`, preferably in a fullscreened terminal window.


### Guidelines

1. Look in `main.js`. Each function has been started for you, but has no code or parameters. Your job is to finish them according to the tests in `main.test.js`.
2. Read those test cases carefully.
3. Do not edit the test file. All your work can and should be done within `main.js`.
4. You may not look at outside sources of any kind. Please feel free to ask for clarifications, though!
5. The last three problems can be solved by using a function or multiple functions that you've written for previous problems, making solving these in order helpful.
6. However, they can sill be tackled in any order. Don't get stuck on any one problem for too long if you're not making progress.
7. Good luck!
